/* Because all browsers have a default font-size of 16px, setting the font-size to 62.5% on the html element gives it a font-size of 10px (10 / 16 * 100 = 62.5) without explicitely setting it to 10px which would prevent zooming. Then, setting a font-size of 1.6rem on the body element simply results in a font-size of 16px, cascading through the whole DOM tree. */

/* Then, if I want an element to have like a 28px font-size, I simply have to do .element { font-size: 2.8rem; }, no matter the size of its parent. */

/* Everything is great, however rem isn’t supported in all browsers, especially not in Internet Explorer 8, which is still required in most projects. It means we have to give a fallback for this browser. */
