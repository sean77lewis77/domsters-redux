                    <p>Jay Skript is going to rock your world!</p>
                    <p>Together with his compatriots The Domsters, Jay is set for world domination. Just you wait and see.</p>
                    <p>Jay Skript has been on the scene since the mid nineties. His talent hasn't always been recognized or fully appreciated. In the early days, he was often unfavorably compared to bigger, similarly-named artists. That's all in the past now.</p>
